# stuff

This repo contains code that isn't significant enough to have own repos. All of this code I wrote while learning how to code in various languages. Some of it was coded along with some online courses. Some of it was written by me when I was experimenting and tinkering on my own. Since a lot of those was written quite some time ago I don't even remember what is inside. Especially in Java folder.
